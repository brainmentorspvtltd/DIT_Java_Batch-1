Java

- WORA: Write Once Run Anywhere
- Java is a platfrom independent or portable
- Platform = O/S + hardware


Source Code (.c) -----> Compile ----> Machine Code (.obj)

- c is not portable or platform independent


source code (.java) ---> Compile ---> Byte code (.class) ----> Interpreter (JRE) ---> Machine code


- Byte code: byte code is not a source code and not a machine code, it is intermediate code.

- JRE: Java Runtime Environment
- Read Byte code and converted into machine code.

JRE
- JVM: Java Virtual Machine
- Predefined Library Files

- Java History

- Invented by James Gosling in 1991
- Developed by Sun Microsystems
- The old name of java is "Oak"
- In 1995, first released publicly as Java "1.0"
- Sun Microsystems sold java to oracle corporation in 2009

- Java Setup

- JDK Download
- JDK Install
- Set Path
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-16.0.1\bin
- this pc--> right click ---> properties ----> Adavanced tab ---> Environment Variables
---> User Variables ----> Path Variable Set ---> Edit ----> New ---> Java Path Paste

JDK Install
- javac: Java Compiler
- java: Run Java Code, (JRE)
- JRE: 
a) JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
b) Libraries
- Java doc
- jar (java archive)

Confirm about Java (JDK Install)
- open CMD/Terminal
- javac -version
- java -version

- Java is used for Enterprise Applications, provide banking solutions.

- Sun Solaris Server - Hardware
- Sun Solaris O/S
- Oracle Ceritfied Java Programmmer: OCJP

Creating first program in java

- Every Java program start with class
- Class name should start with capital letter
- Class name should be same as file name
- Class name starts with either alphabet or special symbol(_, $)

javac Filename.java
- compile the code

java Classname/Bytecode
- execute / run the code

javac comes from JDK
java comes from JRE, Now JRE starts searching for main

Main method
- main is an entry point of every java program
- without main java will compile the code and convert it into byte code, but it can't execute the code 
or interpret the code

4 types of scopes in java

- public: global, which is accessible for all from anywhere
- private: accessible within the class only
- protected: can be accessible outside the package by using inheritance, it can also be 
accessible inside the package
- default: the scope can be accessible by any class but within the same package

Why main is public?

- JRE uses main
- java command trigger the JRE
- JRE load your class in the memory
- JRE is looking for main
- JRE is outside from your directory/folder/package
- And outside the package things can access

Why main is static?

- static things are loaded into memory when class is loaded.


why main is void?

- main is void in nature
- main is entry point so there is no need to return anything

Main Arguments - String args[]

- main has command line arguments
- we can make our own command
- we can pass any number of arguments, that's why it is array
- All arguments are pass to main in form of array of String

What is String?

- String is a collection of Characters
- String internally is a char[]
- String is a predefined class in java as it is in capital letter

What is System.out.println()?

- println()- print in new line, println comes from out project
- out: out is a predefined object, which belongs to PrintStream class
- System is a predefined class used for input, output, and error
e.g: System.in, System.out, System.err

Println vs Print

- println: print in new line
- print: here cursor remains at the end of the text

Can we Overload main()?

- Yes, we can overload the main
- when we execute the class, JVM starts execution with public static void main(String[] args).

Define Variable , Variable Declaration, Local Variable initlize must

- Java doesn't have any garbage value
- It throws error
- Local variable must be initiazed before use, otherwise compilation fails


Assignment:

1. Print Z
2. Salary Calculator
- Take Basic Salary of Employee as Input
- Then Print

HRA: 30% of the Basic Salary
DA: 20% of the Basic Salary
TA: 10% of the Basic Salary
MA: 15% of the Basic Salary
PF: 5% of the Basic Salary

Gross Salary: BS + HRA + DA + TA + MA
Net Salary: Gross Salary - PF
