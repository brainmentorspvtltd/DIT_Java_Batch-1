Data Types

1. Primitive Data Types = Value Data Types (in lowercase)

It is used to store integral only

Enter the age

byte = 1 byte = 8 bits

1 bit + -
7 bits number range
Bit 0, 1 base 2

-2 ^ 7 to 2 ^ 7 - 1
-128 to 127

byte - 1 byte
short - 2 bytes
int - 4 bytes
long - 8 bytes

Decimal/Floating Point Values

float - 4 bytes
double - 8 bytes

char - 2 bytes
- Java works on unicode (universal code)

boolean - size depending o/s
- true or false

boolean - 1 byte / 2 bytes / 4 bytes

2. Reference Data Types = Address Data Types (in uppercase/capital letter)

String - always depending upon o/s
- Collection of Characters


Wrapper Classes in java

Wrapper class is a class that is used to convert primitive data types into objects.

primitive data types			Wrapper Class

int					Integer
char					Character
byte					Byte
short					Short
long					Long
float					Float
double					Double
boolean					Boolean


Autoboxing: 
Automatic conversion
convert primitive data types into object of their wrapper classses 

e.g: int to Integer

Unboxing:
It is a reverse procsessing of autoboxing.

e.g: Integer to int

Assignment:

1. Improve the Salary Calculator

In Gross Salary if it is > 9L so tax is 30%,
If it is b/w <9L to >7L it is 20%
If it is <7L to >= 5L it is 10%
otherwise 0 tax

2. Grading system

Enter 3 Subject's Marks:90, 78, 77 and do Total and get the percentage

- 90 to 70: A grade
- 70 to 60: B grade
- 60 to 50: C grade
else D grade
