Java

Class Relationship: Inheritance

- Communicate b/w two classes

1. IS - A Inheritance

- BMW is a car
- Lion is a animal
- SavingAccount is a account
- Ram is a student
- Parrot is a bird

2. HAS - A Inheritance

- BMW has a driver
- Customer has a order
- Customer has a account


In Development:

- One File one class
- If your class is public so class name must be same as file name 
- If one file (X.java) has 3 classes e.g:
class X{} class Y{} class Z{}
After compile it will create 3 byte codes
X.class Y.class Z.class


Overriding:

- When parent feature is outdated so we override the parent feature in a child
- Overriding hide the parent feature

1. Must be inheritance
2. Method signature must be same
void roi(), same child has same void roi()


task: 1

- Single Inheritance (P - C)

vehicle
car

- Use both constructors in each class: default + Paramaterized


Task- 2
parent class - varName
child class - varName

child class 
child class variable
parent class variable


Task 3:

parent class
variable or data

child class access parent class variable 

finalize()

- finalize is used to perform clean up process just before object is garbage collected.

Multilevel Inheritance

	A (P)
	
	
	B (C1)

	
	C (C2)
