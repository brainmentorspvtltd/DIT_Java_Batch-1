Java

Object Casting:

Upcasting: child object convert into parent object
Downcasting: parent object convert into child object

Task - 1:

Use Upcasting and Downcasting
Shape class, Rectangle class, Square class, Circle class

Multiple Inheritance

	A (P) B (P)

       	C(C)

Abstract Method:

- can only be declared, not defined

Abstract Class

- Abstract class can have abstract methods
- You can't create objects of abstract class

Interface

Like a class, an interface can have methods and variables but the methods declared in an interface are by default abstract (only method declare not defined)

- Total Abstraction
- it supports multiple interface/inheritance

Task - 2

Interface and use Lambda Expression

- Perform Subtraction between two numbers

Task - 3

Use Interface 
- And implement method in interface

RAM: Random Access Memory

- Temporary Memory or Volatile Memory
- Main Memory
- Primary Memory

Sections in RAM Memory

- Heap: Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Stack: Static Memory Allocation
LIFO: Last in First Out

Memory Management:

- Heap, Permspace, Stack
- Young and Old Generation
- G.C
a) Minor G.C
b) Moas G.C

- Permspace is removed from java 8 now metaspace is introduced

Can we increase/decrease size of stack and heap?

- Yes
- Stack: -Xss10m
- Heap:
	- Initial size of heap: -Xms20m
	- Maximum size of heap: -Xmx2000m

- Performance Monitoring Tool: Visual VM, Visual GC

Task - 4:

- Stack and Heap: Overflow

String Handling:

What is String?

- Collection of Characters
- It is internally a char[]
- e.g: String name = "Ram";
- char[] name = {'R', 'a', 'm'};
- String is a predefine class in java: Predefine methods
- It is also treat like a data type
- String is a final class, so you can't inherit it
- String objects are created in 2 ways:

1) String Literal Style
String name = "Ram";

2) String Object Style
String name = new String("Ram");

String use String Pool
String objects are immutable
- String doesn't change existing or original objects, it can create new memory or object all the time

String Mututable: StringBuffer and StringBuilder
