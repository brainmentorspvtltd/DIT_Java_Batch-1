Java

2 major types of Programming:

- Procedural: Functions - Divide a problem into functions
- OOPS(Object Oriented Programming Language): Wrap all the variables and functions/methods into 
a single unit. e.g: class


Why OOPS?

In C Programming:

class A
{
int x, y;

add()
{}

sub()
{}

div()
{}

mul()
{}
}

class B
{
sin()
{
  double x;
}
}

Data hiding
Data Security, no ambiguity, no conflict

Is java has global variable?

No, because in java every program start with class and class doesn't have global variable.

What is OOPS?

- Divide a problem into classes
- OOPS Features

1. Class, Object

- object: real world entity, physical entity

e.g: a/c, car, fan, projector
e.g: ram, amit, shyam, rahul.....

- Class: Collection of Similar Objects, logical entity
Blueprint, Category, Layout
- Collection of Features/Characteristics
e.g: Human (Features Brain, Height, Weight, Age)

- object: ram brain sharp, 6 feet height, .....


OOAD: Object Oriented Analysis and Design

- To make your clean code
- OOAD provides SOLID principle

SOLID
D - DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself

1. Security of the Code

- Data Security: private member variables

2. Duplicacy in code

- Copy paste alternate make function/method and call it


This keyword:
- It holds current object's reference


Encapsulation

- Wrap all the data members and member methods/functions into a single unit.
e.g: class

- Data Hiding: Make member variables private

Good/Secure Encapsulation = Data Hiding + Encapsulation

Constructor:

Q. Need to initialize the member variable when object is construct.
- We need constructor for this
- Constructor is call when you create an object
- So constructor will initialize the member variable
- Constructor name is same as class name
- It is called only once
- One class can have multiple constructors, so this thing is called constructor overloading
- Every class by default have default constructor
- So if you create any other constructor the default one is killed


When we need multiple constructor calls in a single call.
- Here, we need constructor chaining.
- This keyword also use for constructor chaining


What is Package?

- Package is a folder behind the scene.
- Package is a collection of classes, interfaces
- We divide a big project into small-2 packages
- So we can group the similar nature code in same kind of package

e.g: User Package - Login, Register, Password Change, Account Delete

Online Exam System

teacher - package
student - package
question - package

Q. Employee Class

- id, name, Basic Salary, company name
- Need 2 constructors: Default and Parameterized
- Company name is fixed for all employees
