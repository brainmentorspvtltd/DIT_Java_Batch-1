DP - Dynamic Programming
- DP is entirely based on Recursion

When should we use DP ?
- Count Something, often number of ways
- Minimize or Maximize something

2 Ways to solve using DP
- Memoization - Top Down
- Tabulation - Bottom Up

1. Fib Series
2. Dice Game
3. Climbing Stairs - HW
4. Pascal Triangle
5. LCS - Longest Common Subsequence 
    Recursive Approach - HW
    Memoization
    Tabulation
6. Knapsack Problem
7. MCP - Minimum Cost Path Problem
8. Subset Sum Problem - HW
9. Edit Distance Problem - HW
10. Coin Change Problem - HW
