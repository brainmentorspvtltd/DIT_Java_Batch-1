Binary Tree
1. Binary Tree Insert

Tree Traversal Classified into 2 categories
- Breadth First or Level Order - Queue
    - Traverse the tree level by level
- Depth First   - Stack
    - we cover one side and complete it and then move to another

2. Pre Order   - Recursive / Iterative
3. In Order    - Recursive / Iterative
4. Post Order  - Recursive / Iterative
5. Level Order
6. Left View    - Recursive / Iterative
7. Right View   - Recursive / Iterative = HW
8. Vertical Order of Tree - Recursive
9. Vertical Order of Tree - Iterative = HW
10. Top View of Tree
11. Height of Tree
12. Count Nodes in a Tree
13. Nodes at K Distance
14. Get Max Element of Tree
15. Find Width of Tree - HW
16. Bottom View of Tree
17. Diagonal View
18. Boundary Traversal of Tree - HW
19. Children Sum Property
20. Construct Sum Tree of a Binary Tree - HW
21. Check for Balanced Tree
22. Diameter of Tree - HW
    - Longest path b/w 2 leaf Nodes
23. Spiral Order of Tree
    - Using Queue
    - Using Stack
24. Print Ancestors of a Node
